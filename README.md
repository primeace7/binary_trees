This project covers all about binary trees and thier associated algorithms implemented in C.
The covered concepts include:
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

For visualization purposes, this project uses [this print function](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x1C.c) to print
binary trees in an easily understandable way.
